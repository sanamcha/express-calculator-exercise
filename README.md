Express Routing Exercises
For this exercise, you will build an Express.js application that performs three statistical operations given an arbitrary amount of numbers:

mean (average)
median (midpoint)
mode (most frequent)
The operations are invoked via one route per operation.

Requirements
The three base routes are /mean, /median, /mode. All accept GET requests

Each route takes a query key of nums which is a comma-separated list of numbers. For example, if I want to get the mean of 1, 3, 5, and 7, that would look like be a GET request to /mean?nums=1,3,5,7.

The response of each operation should be JSON which looks like this:

response: {
  operation: "mean",
  value: 4
}
The app should “gracefully” handle the following errors:

Passing in an invalid number (NaN errors). For instance, /mean?nums=foo,2,3 should respond with a 400 Bad Request status code and a response that saying something like: foo is not a number.
Empty input: /mean without passing any nums should respond with a 400 Bad Request status code saying something like nums are required.
Make sure you have unit tests for mean, median and mode.
